# ft_services
## Description

It's a setup configuration for Kubernetes cluster including different web-services.

It was made due to my studying in 21-school, Russia.
The main goal of project - learn how to organize and setup cluster in Kubernetes with Docker.

## Requirments

You need to install [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) and
[virtualbox](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/ "checkout for virtualbox driver") minikube driver. Than launch the 

`./setup.sh` 

and wait untill cluster sets up.

After setting up checkout for `minikube dashboard` and enjoy this little cute cluster.
